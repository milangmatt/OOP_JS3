## How to use the repo

There are several directories provided

- `src`: the folder contains various module wise sample programs that might be useful while you study
- `Study Material`: the folder contains the PDFs to the lesson
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
